# Word-guess
A word guess game. Homework #3

This is a hangman-like game where the object is to guess a city in the world. 

This is a web-page but will only work on a laptop or desktop. The web page requires a keyboard.
On the iPhone it is not possible to guess characters because no keyboard is available. So, this
is not mobile-friendly.

When a word is guessed, a photo of the city is displayed and the national anthem of the country is played. Fortunately, there is a stop button, to stop the music.
